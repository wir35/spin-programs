# Spin FV1 Programs

This repo includes the _mono_ FV-1 program banks that I have written for use
specifically in guitar pedals.

All of these programs exclusively use the left inputs and outputs and assume
that the right channel is unconnected. Additionally, all programs provide
digital feedback, but no wet/dry mix control. That is assumed to be provided by
the host pedal.

If you are looking for a platform for these programs, the
[Arachnid from PedalPCB](https://www.pedalpcb.com/product/arachnid/) is a good
choice, and is fairly easy to build.

Some of these programs are derived from those originally written for the Sputnik
Buchla format 289 Dual Defect Processor, and the original stereo programs can
be found at [github.com/wir35/dual-defect-289](https://github.com/wir35/dual-defect-289).
